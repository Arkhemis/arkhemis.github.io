For the past three years, I've been developing a mobile app. Well, to be fair, it was more during 6 intense months. You see, the problem when you don't know anything about the mobile ecosystem is that you don't know where to start. And when your colleague, who handles the marketing side, user segmentation, investment meetings, basically, how to find users (very important), retain them (extremely important), and find investors to finance the project (imperative), you're pretty much left to fend for yourself to develop everything.
